// ‚ùì DESCRIPTION:
// Converting a 12-hour time like "8:30 am" or "8:30 pm" to 24-hour time (like "0830" or "2030") sounds easy enough, right? Well, let's see if you can do it!
// You will have to define a function, which will be given an hour (always in the range of 1 to 12, inclusive), a minute (always in the range of 0 to 59, inclusive), and a period (either a.m. or p.m.) as input.
// Your task is to return a four-digit string that encodes that time in 24-hour time.
// By convention, noon is 12:00 pm, and midnight is 12:00 am.
// On 12-hours clock, there is no 0 hour, and time just after midnight is denoted as, for example, 12:15 am. On 24-hour clock, this translates to 0015.
//
// ‚úÖ SOLUTION:
function to24hourtime(hour, minute, period) {
    let result = "";
    if (period === "am") {
        if (hour < 10) {
            result += "0" + hour;
        } else if (hour === 12) {
            result += "00";
        } else result += hour;
    }
    if (period === "pm") {
        if (hour === 12) {
            result += 12;
        } else {
            result += hour + 12;
        }
    }
    if (minute < 10) {
        result += "0" + minute;
    } else {
        result += minute;
    }
    return result;
}

// üìå TESTCASE:
console.log(to24hourtime(1, 0, "am")); // "0100"
console.log(to24hourtime(1, 0, "pm")); // "1300"
console.log(to24hourtime(12, 0, "am")); // "0000"
console.log(to24hourtime(12, 0, "pm")); // "1200"
console.log(to24hourtime(6, 30, "am")); // "0630"
console.log(to24hourtime(9, 45, "pm")); // "2145"
