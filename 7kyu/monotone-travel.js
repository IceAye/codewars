// ‚ùì DESCRIPTION:
// Peter lives on a hill, and he always moans about the way to his home. "It's always just up. I never get a rest". But
// you're pretty sure that at least at one point Peter's altitude doesn't rise, but fall. To get him, you use a
// nefarious plan: you attach an altimeter to his backpack and you read the data from his way back at the next day.
// Task
// You're given a list of compareable elements heights = [h1, h2, h3, ‚Ä¶, hn]
// Your job is to check whether for any
// x all successors are greater or equal to x. If the list is empty, Peter has probably removed your altimeter, so we
// cannot prove him wrong and he's still right:
//
// ‚úÖ SOLUTION:

const isMonotone = function (arr) {
    for (let i = 0; i < arr.length - 1; i++) {
        if (arr[i] > arr[i + 1]) return false;
    }
    return true;
};

// üìå TESTCASE:
console.log(isMonotone([1 , 2 , 3 , 3 , 4 , 5]));
console.log(isMonotone([5 , 5 , 5 , 5]));
console.log(isMonotone([1 , 2 , 3 , 5]));
console.log(isMonotone([5 , 4 , 3 , 1]));
console.log(isMonotone([1 , 4 , 5 , 1]));
