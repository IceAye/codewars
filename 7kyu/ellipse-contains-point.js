// ‚ùì DESCRIPTION:
// You are given a length of string and two thumbtacks. One thumbtack goes into the focus point F‚ÇÄ with coordinates x‚ÇÄ and y‚ÇÄ, and the other goes into focus point F‚ÇÅ with coordinates x‚ÇÅ and y‚ÇÅ. The string is then tied at the ends to the thumbtacks and has length l excluding the knots at the ends. If you pull the string taught with a pencil and draw around the plane you'll have an ellipse with focuses at F‚ÇÄ and F‚ÇÅ. Given a new point P, determine if it falls inside of the ellipse.
// You must write a function that takes arguments f0, f1, l, and p and returns true or false depending on whether or not p falls inside the ellipse.
// Each of f0, f1, and p has has properties x and y for its coordinates.
// You will never be given the case where the string is too short to reach between the points.

// ‚úÖ SOLUTION:
function ellipseContainsPoint(f0, f1, l, p) {
    function getDistance(a, b) {
        return Math.hypot(b.x - a.x, b.y - a.y);
    }
    const d0 = getDistance(p, f0);
    const d1 = getDistance(p, f1);
    return d0 + d1 <= l;
}

// üìå TESTCASE:
console.log(ellipseContainsPoint({ x: 0, y: 0 }, { x: 0, y: 0 }, 2, { x: 0, y: 0 }));
console.log(ellipseContainsPoint({ x: 0, y: 0 }, { x: 0, y: 0 }, 2, { x: 1, y: 1 }));
