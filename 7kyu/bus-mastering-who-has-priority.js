// ‚ùì DESCRIPTION:
// When multiple master devices are connected to a single bus, there needs to be an arbitration in order to choose which of them can have access to the bus (and 'talk' with a slave).
// We implement here a very simple model of bus mastering. Given n, a strictly-positive integer representing the number of masters connected to the bus, and a fixed priority order (the first master has more access priority than the second and so on...), the task is to choose the selected master.
// In practice, you are given a string inp of length n representing the n masters' requests to get access to the bus, and you should return a string representing the masters, showing which one of them was granted access.
// (The parameter n is redundant as it is always equal to the length of inp.)
//
// Detailed Example
// The string "1101" means that master 0, master 1 and master 3 have requested access to the bus.
// Knowing that master 0 has the highest priority, the output of the function should be: "1000"

// ‚úÖ SOLUTION:
function arbitrate(input, n) {
    const array = new Array(n).fill('0');
    const index = input.indexOf('1');
    array[index] = '1';
    return array.join('');
}

// üìå TESTCASE:
console.log(arbitrate("001000101", 9), "001000000");
console.log(arbitrate("000000101", 9), "000000100");
console.log(arbitrate("0000", 4), "0000");
